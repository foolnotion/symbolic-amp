Evaluation of symbolic expression trees with C++AMP

Symbolic regression methods like genetic programming use trees to represent mathematical formulas. Fast evaluation of such trees is important especially when the input data is big. 

This project tries to evaluate symbolic expression trees on the GPU using C++AMP.

To build the project you will need the latest version of Visual Studio with C++17 support.
